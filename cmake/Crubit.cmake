# CMake support for generating Rust bindings for C++ libraries with Crubit
# (`rs_bindings_from_cc`).
#
# Requirements: Clang with libc++, a nightly Rust toolchain (or
# RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1, which Crubit sets for the crates it links), and
# `rs_bindings_from_cc`, chosen by CRUBIT_RS_BINDINGS_FROM_CC: if unset, it is
# built from source (cmake/rs_bindings_from_cc); if empty, it is found on the
# PATH; otherwise it is the binary at that path.
#
# See docs/overview/build_systems.md.

# Functions use the policy settings in effect where they are defined, so this
# applies to all of Crubit's functions, whatever the policies of the project
# calling them. The minimum matches the top-level CMakeLists.txt so that
# including Crubit for its C++ libraries alone keeps working on older CMake;
# bindings need 3.22, which _crubit_init_toolchain checks.
